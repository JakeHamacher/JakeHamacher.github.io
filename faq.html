                            <p>Minimum credit score requirements vary by loan type. Conventional loans typically require 620+, FHA loans accept scores as low as 580 (or 500 with 10% down), and VA loans often have more flexible requirements. However, higher scores generally qualify for better rates.</p>

                            <p>Pre-qualification is a quick estimate based on unverified information you provide. Pre-approval involves verification of your financial documents and carries more weight with sellers. We recommend getting pre-approved before house hunting.</p>
